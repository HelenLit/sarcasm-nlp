# sarcasm-nlp
In this my laboratory work from the course "Natural Language Processing in TensorFlow" from DeepLearning.AI in Coursera platform.

Here I will be applying what I've learned in the past two lectures to preprocess the [News Headlines Dataset for Sarcasm Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/rmisra/news-headlines-dataset-for-sarcasm-detection/home). This contains news headlines which are labeled as sarcastic or not.
